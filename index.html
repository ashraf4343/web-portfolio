    <p>The model initially classifies the panda picture correctly, but when some noise, imperceptible to human beings, is injected into the picture, the resulting prediction of the model is changed to another animal, gibbon, even with such a high confidence. To us, it appears as if the initial and altered images are the same, although it is radically different to the model. This illustrates the threat these adversarial attacks pose — we may not perceive the difference so we cannot tell an adversarial attack as happened. Hence, although the output of the model may be altered, we cannot tell if the output is correct or incorrect.</p>
